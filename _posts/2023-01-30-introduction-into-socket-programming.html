<p>Greetings to everyone, in this article, we will focus on socket programming in C, for a better fundamental understanding. We will explore the creation of sockets, establishing connections, sending and receiving data, and a high-level interface for client-server applications. By the end of the article, you will have a understanding of socket programming.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jmPR0TPDoYdUpXnUNqZQlA.png" /></figure><p>You can check full source code here:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/BitR13x/SimpleHTTPC">https://github.com/BitR13x/SimpleHTTPC</a></p><p><strong>Keep in mind that my code isn’t perfect and can be definitely upgraded, but still it can save you some time.</strong></p><h3>What is “Socket Programming”?</h3><p>Socket Programming is a fundamental aspect of computer networking that enables communication between applications on different devices. It provides a low-level interface for exchanging data between processes over a network. The concept of sockets is based on the idea of having a unique address, consisting of an IP address and port number, for each process to identify itself and communicate with other processes.</p><h4>Types of sockets (stream and datagram)</h4><p>There are two main types of sockets: stream sockets (<em>TCP</em>) and datagram sockets (<em>UDP</em>). Stream sockets provide a reliable, stream-oriented connection between two processes, while datagram sockets offer a best-effort, datagram-oriented connection.</p><h3>Creating Sockets</h3><p>In C, sockets are created using the <strong>socket() </strong>function, which is a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets">Berkeley sockets API</a>. This function returns a socket descriptor, which is used to identify the socket in future operations. The <strong>socket()</strong> function takes three arguments: the <em>address family</em>, <em>socket type</em>, and <em>protocol</em>. The address family specifies the type of address used (e.g. <em>IPv4 </em>or <em>IPv6</em>), the socket type defines the type of socket (e.g. <em>stream </em>or <em>datagram</em>), and the protocol sets the specific protocol to be used (e.g. <em>TCP </em>or <em>UDP</em>).</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/5c9874646ca140ca686f68fa417a8f06/href">https://medium.com/media/5c9874646ca140ca686f68fa417a8f06/href</a></iframe><h4>Establishing a Connection</h4><p>Once the socket is created, a connection can be established between the client and server using the <strong>connect()</strong> function. The <strong>connect()</strong> function takes a single argument, the address of the server to connect to, which is specified as a <strong>sockaddr structure</strong>. The <strong>connect()</strong> function returns zero on success, or a negative value on failure. After a successful connection, the client and server can begin exchanging data.</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/c82aa67292c53bcb4a4bcb30998abbdd/href">https://medium.com/media/c82aa67292c53bcb4a4bcb30998abbdd/href</a></iframe><h4>Sending and Receiving Data</h4><p>Data is sent from one socket to another using the <strong>send()</strong> function. The <strong>send()</strong> function takes three arguments: the socket descriptor, the data to be sent, and the length of the data. Data is received using the <strong>recv()</strong> function, which takes four arguments: the socket descriptor, a buffer to store the data, the length of the buffer, and flags. The <strong>recv()</strong> function returns the number of bytes received, or a negative value on error.</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/e689a7ea8d092b5dc73b82fc88c18b55/href">https://medium.com/media/e689a7ea8d092b5dc73b82fc88c18b55/href</a></iframe><h4>High-Level Interface for Client-Server Applications</h4><p>While the low-level socket API is useful for simple applications, more complex client-server applications can benefit from the use of a higher-level interface. In C, this is achieved through the use of libraries such as <strong>libsocket </strong>or <strong>libnetwork</strong>. These libraries provide a simpler, more abstract interface for creating and managing sockets, as well as functions for handling common tasks such as binding to a port and listening for incoming connections. Using a high-level interface can greatly simplify the process of creating complex client-server applications, allowing developers to focus on the implementation of their application’s specific functionality.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Sockets are essential for creating network applications. Whether you are working on a simple client-server application or a complex networked system, socket programming provides a flexible and efficient way to transfer data over a network.</p><p>Thanks for reading!
